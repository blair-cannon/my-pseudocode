Project Description
Create an in-depth pseudocode file documenting a real-world process that you are familiar with.

For this project, think of this as you explaining to someone how you do something. Remember, you are not writing code. 

Pseudocode should be human-readable detailed instructions for anyone to be able to follow.

Tech Stack
Markdown
Setup
Pick a topic to pseudocode
Create GitHub repo for example: my-pseudocode
Application File Structure
repo/
README.md - any important information about the repo or project
pseudocode.md - your project file
.gitignore - file that omits any directory/file from being tracked

Develop
Create a dev branch to commit your code
Add content and elements to your file
Save often, and commit to your development branch on GitHub when important changes happen
Push your commits to GitHub remote
For bug fixes, refactored code, and feature branches, you must create a branch off of dev onto a new-feature branch and create a Pull Request into dev when complete

Deploy
Create a Pull Request from dev into main
Confirm your pseudocode is up to date and looks correctLink your project to an existing portfolio in settings
Submit your final working version
Requirements
To complete the assignment, you must complete the following:

Pick a topic to pseudocode

You may choose from the following list or provide a solution to something you know
Brewing a cup of coffee or tea
Driving a remote control car
Cooking your favorite meal (can't be PB&J)
Downloading an app
Washing your hands
Studying for an exam
Describing how an elevator works
Write your pseudocode in the .md (markdown) file using pseudo code standard language
File must be formatted correctly using markdown
Tip: Read the pseudocode to yourself out loud to make sure the instructions make sense. Consider giving your pseudocode file to someone you know like a friend or family member to see if they get stuck at some point with your instructions. Take the feedback provided and add another step or refactor in order to clarify. 


Tip: First solve for procedural pseudocode, then solve for functional pseudocode, and finally, solve for object oriented pseudocode.

Remember, pseudocode should be detailed enough to get the job done without any clarifying questions, but basic enough for anyone to understand.
